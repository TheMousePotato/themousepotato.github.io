I am Navaneeth Suresh, a senior undergrad at [IIT Kharagpur](http://iitkgp.ac.in/), where I was advised by [Pabitra Mitra](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~pabitra/) for my thesis project on image super-resolution using generative adversarial networks. During my life at college, I used to spend time promoting open source awareness being a part of [Kharagpur Open Source Society](https://kossiitkgp.org/).

I like to solve real-world problems using simple, maintainable and readable code where I often work on software engineering projects trying to make computers reduce human workload and occasionally on research projects in the intersection of computer vision and deep learning.
