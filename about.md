Hola gente! I'm Navaneeth, a sophomore at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. I'm a free software activist, ML/DL enthusiast and interested in experimenting and learning new stuff from good fellas. Pythonista since programming.

I am also an Executive Head at Kharagpur Open Source Society, where we organise workshops and events related to open source and programming.

I kill my free time mostly by watching [movies](https://letterboxd.com/navaneethsuresh/), listening to music and [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/themousepotato) mostly non-fiction. I'm a huge fan of Denis villeneuve and Robin Williams movies. I love going for long walks and swimming.

Interested in talking about anything? [Ping me](https://themousepotato.github.io/contact/). I would love to have an interesting talk.
