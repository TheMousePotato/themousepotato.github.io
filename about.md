Hola gente! I'm Navaneeth, a sophomore at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. I'm a free software activist, ML/DL enthusiast and interested in experimenting and learning new stuff from good fellas. Pythonista since programming.

I am also a Core Team Member at Kharagpur Open Source Society, where we organise workshops and events related to open source and programming.

I kill my free time mostly by watching movies, listening to music and learning new languages. I'm a huge fan of Denis villeneuve and Robin Williams movies. I love going for long walks and swimming.

Interested in talking about anything? Ping me in any of the following social networks. I would love to have an interesting talk.
