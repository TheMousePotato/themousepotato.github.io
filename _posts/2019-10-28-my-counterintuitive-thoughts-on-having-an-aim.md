This blog post arises after talk of one of my friends to me on the necessity of having an aim. I don’t think I’ll stick to the title and write things around that. I’ll try my best to do so. Topics can change every time. If you think I’m wasting your time, feel free to stop reading.

I’ve been continuously questioning about my purpose of life these days as religion failed to convince me. Then, I realized that the random things we do can occasionally make some sense to something which might be easy to explain after a long run. Can having an aim ever be toxic? In other words, do we need an aim every time? It might result in an obsession to achieve things rather than enjoying the things we do to get the result. We tend to lose small things when we always focus on the big picture. I’ve recently read that productivity can be increased when we don’t schedule things. Someone once told me that I’m doing great and in the “right” path, suggested me to continue what I was doing. How did they know that the path I took is right? They haven’t ever been there in my shoes. Is there a path anyway? We make mistakes, learn from them and don’t let us repeat them in the future. That’s how a machine learns. How do we differ from them? Well, we got intelligence it seems. In India, most of the people pursue science in hopes of making a consistent source of a good amount of money. I’d come across people who don’t even believe the content in the textbooks and are stubborn on the things their religion taught them. Very few of them enjoy the things they study. Some people question the curricula and study on their own the things that interest them. This method has a speciality. Things aren’t linear. There is an infinite number of combinations of things we can do and there is no guarantee to anything. We might reach somewhere which would make us happy, but we might miss some things.

When did we start thinking about an aim? Our parents, relatives and teachers planted those thoughts on us. They might don’t force us. But, unknowingly they wanted us to do things which makes sense to them. We can’t blame anyone. It’s clear that our thoughts changes with time. When we look back, we may blush at the things we did in high school which we thought would make a serious impact. Some things did and some didn’t.

One thing that I could be certain about now is that having an increased number of aims can shrink our lives fast. Life is what happens when we’re busy planning something. Cheers!
