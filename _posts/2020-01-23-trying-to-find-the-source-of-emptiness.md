Have you ever felt happy for crying? I didn't mean crying being happy. Being happy for the tears that came from sadness. That sounds weird, but it makes sense sometimes. You might want to think about emptiness at this moment and then you'll probably get the context. Have you ever tried so hard to cry when you felt something that kept pushing you inwards from all directions and made your heart heavy, but you couldn't make it as you weren't sad and only empty? That's how emptiness haunts you. Crying for sadness is natural if you can keep the myth of toxic masculinity aside. Instead, what would you do if you don't feel anything? Think of an occasion were you couldn't think of anything per se. This sounds really stupid when I say it. But it happens and it's worse. In this post, I'll try to investigate the source of this emptiness.

### Lack of integrity

Mr. Peanutbutter from the TV Show Bojack Horseman says, "The universe is a cruel, uncaring void. The key to being happy isn't a search for meaning. It's to just keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense, and eventually, you'll be dead." This unimportant nonsense could be the things you do with lack of integrity. Doing something just for the sake of it or being forced to do that as all the people around you are doing it without much interest or it could be something you do without making use of your true potential. Studying for the subjects you don't like for example. These could be your backup plans as well. The greed for prestige and money also might be the reason. Sometimes survival could be the reason and that's worse.

### Playing a lot of zero-sum games
In game theory and economic theory, a zero-sum game is a mathematical representation of a situation in which each participant's gain or loss of utility is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the utility of the other participants. In simple words, for every winner, there should be a loser. Take the relative grading system in the college for example. These zero-sum games suck the energy out of you and make you more selfish.

### Self-obsession
Not showing genuine interest in people around you might eventually lead to an existential crisis. Perhaps exploring the habits of other people and trying them out on your own can help with the bonding.

### Lots of free time
There is a lot of free time and you want to do something productive, but afraid to start something new. This fear to get started arises due to the path problem. Now, what's a path problem? We might think that being selective and too much specific generates a path thereby a final destination. Bojack Horseman feels like his life is just a series of unrelated wacky adventures. We shouldn't be losing track of our hobbies. In school, unknowingly, we were doing a variety of things. We were reading poetry, philosophy, psychology, listening to the news channel your father always watches, doing math, playing football with friends, etc. When you are in your early 20s, your life is similar to a video game which is played on strategy and you have all the freedom and power with you, but don't know the rules. So, you learn by making a move and learn from your mistakes.

### Overthinking
As we grow up, we eventually end up questioning the purpose of our life and try to find the meaning of everything we do. For someone who believes in religion, everything converges to an invisible entity and there is no room for questions there. For someone who doesn't, it's infinite. Our questions might end up in other questions which might get stuck in recursion. Say suppose you are good at problem-solving and there aren't many problems for you to solve. Then, eventually, you might end up creating some, finding happiness in solving some of those and getting sad for failing to solve the rest. You can call them first world problems maybe.

### Internet
This is the most underrated cause. A friend of mine said this to me once. The internet is the connection to the netherworld where the spirits those entrap us in the loneliness come from(plot of Pulse, A Japanese movie). But, it gets into you only if you give it access into you and that spirit will haunt you forever until your death. Take scrolling your social media feeds whenever you are free for example. There is a lot of information and there is no holy grail to it. You might want to be extremely specific to make use of it wisely. These tools are designed in such a way that if you try some of their features, you might eventually get addicted to it.

I've been rearranging these points in a particular order and finally got some order. Now, try to find the connection between these points and let me know if you find something. Cheers!
